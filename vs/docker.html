            <p>Thinking of making the switch to Boxfuse to run your JVM and Node.js apps on AWS?</p>
            <p>We want to make the decision as easy as possible, so we’ve put together some info that’ll help you decide which option is best for you.</p>
            <p>Below, you'll find information to help you compare Boxfuse and Docker, including features, pricing and thoughts from current Boxfuse customers who have made the switch.</p>

            <h2>1. Boxfuse is much easier and better integrated than Docker</h2>
            <p>Boxfuse is all about making you productive so you can focus on delighting your customers instead
                dealing with infrastructure issues. We made sure Boxfuse is a joy to use by making running
                JVM and Node.js applications on AWS absolutely trivial. There are no lengthy tool chains to master,
                no complicated integrations and no tedious OS provisioning and hardening.
                Instead all you need is a single command, <strong>boxfuse run</strong>,
                which will take you all the way from JVM or Node.js application to fully-provisioned AWS infrastructure with no configuration required:</p>

            <pre class="console">&gt; <strong>boxfuse run</strong> myapp-1.0.jar

            <p>Boxfuse does this by first analysing your application and then that information to automatically
                generate an image with a minimal Linux-based OS on-the-fly. Boxfuse then uploads your new image to AWS,
                converts it to an AMI and provisions all the necessary infrastructure in the region of your choice.</p>

            <p>Boxfuse runs natively on Windows, Mac and Linux and comes with special optimizations for popular tools and frameworks
                like Spring Boot, Dropwizard, Grails, Play, Executable Jars, Tomcat, TomEE and Node.js.</p>

            <p>Boxfuse goes well beyond what you would expect and is able to read your framework's native configuration files
                and automatically configures security groups, load balancers and more based on the port and healthcheck information
                they contain, with no additional effort required on your part (needless to say, you are of course able to override these defaults should you want to).</p>

            <h2>2. Boxfuse images are smaller and deployment is simpler</h2>
            <p>At Boxfuse we strongly believe that being able to iterate quickly is a must. And that's why we've built
            a unique image creation process that produces ultra small images in seconds. See for yourself how the images for the
                Spring Boot application from the getting started pages on this site compare:</p>

            <img src="/assets/img/docker-vs-boxfuse-image-size.png">

            <p>Not only are Boxfuse images much smaller, but they also contain a bootloader and a kernel so you don't need
            any additional base operating system, engine or agent to run them:</p>

            <img src="/assets/img/docker-vs-boxfuse-stack.png">

            <p>Boxfuse images are converter into very small AMIs which tie in natively with all the important native AWS
            services like ELB health checks, auto-scaling and security groups.</p>

                <blockquote>For containerization of our core api, we use Boxfuse.  The Boxfuse
                    service supports Dropwizard applications out of the box and provides a
                    highly efficient method of building deployable images that are
                    optimized for speed and space. We have found Boxfuse to produce
                    smaller images than Docker ... and it’s also 10x easier to use.

            <h2>3. Boxfuse is built for Continuous Deployment</h2>
            <p>Continuous Deployment is critically important for many companies today, allowing them to innovate and iterate faster.</p>

            <p>Boxfuse fully embraces this by treating build tool plugins as first-class citizens, making it effortless
                to integrate AMI building into your pipeline. In addition to its command-line client,
                Boxfuse comes with both Maven and Gradle plugins which can be readily integrated through the usual means:</p>

            <p>Gradle: <code>build.gradle</code></p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">plugins {
    id "com.boxfuse.client" version "{{site.boxfuseVersion}}"
}</pre>

            <p>Maven: <code>pom.xml</code></p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">&lt;plugin&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.boxfuse.client&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;boxfuse-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;{{site.boxfuseVersion}}&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;</pre>

            <p>For rapid turnarounds and fast feedback, Boxfuse also lets you run your images on VirtualBox. This is a
            great way to run your integration tests locally before creating an AMI. And unlike Docker, Boxfuse's client
                runs natively on Windows, Mac and Linux with no special shell or setup required.</p>

            <h2>4. Boxfuse is affordable</h2>
            <p>We get it, Docker is free.</p>
            <p>And free is a great price, especially for small businesses.</p>
            <p>But we believe that the value you’ll get from Boxfuse <em>far</em> outweighs the cost. And our customers agree.</p>
            <p>If our zero configuration application deployment features can save your team just <em>30 minutes per month</em>,
                then Boxfuse will more than pay for itself.</p>
            <p>Our pricing is simple: your first application is on us and after that plans start at just $25 per month.</p>

            <h2>5. Boxfuse is here to help</h2>
            <p>We're committed to making sure that you have the best experience you possibly can using Boxfuse.</p>
