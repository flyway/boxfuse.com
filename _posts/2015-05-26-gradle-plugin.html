    <p>Here are Boxfuse we pride ourselves for providing you with the <a href="/blog/welcome.html">easiest solution
        to produce minimal and secure images for your JVM-apps</a> that can then be
        deployed unchanged on VirtualBox and AWS.</p>

    <p>As shown in our three part article on <a href="/blog/dropwizard-aws.html">creating a Continuous Deployment
    pipeline for Dropwizard-based unikernels from GitHub to AWS</a>, we relied
    on Travis CI and the Boxfuse Maven plugin to fuse and run the images.</p>

    <p>We always strongly believed in direct build tool integration. That's
        also the reason why we've had Maven support from the get go. However
        these days a large number of you favor <a href="https://gradle.org">Gradle</a> and its small and
        readable build files to build your projects. Today we are happy to
        announce the <strong>release of the Boxfuse Gradle plugin</strong>. You can now
        use all Boxfuse commands directly from within your Gradle build.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">How does it work?</h2>

    <p>You can use the <a href="/docs/gradle">Boxfuse Gradle plugin</a> in a number of ways.
    The easiest is to simply include the Boxfuse plugin in <code>build.gradle</code> and
    add some basic configuration to the Boxfuse extension:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">buildscript {
    repositories {
        // https is disabled until https://issues.gradle.org/browse/GRADLE-3250 is fixed
        maven { url 'http://files.boxfuse.com' }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "com.boxfuse.client:boxfuse-gradle-plugin:{{site.boxfuseVersion}}"
    }
}

apply plugin: 'boxfuse'

boxfuse {
    <strong>user='<em>your-boxfuse-client-user</em>'</strong>
    <strong>secret='<em>your-boxfuse-client-secret</em>'</strong>
}</pre>

    <p>You can now execute all Boxfuse commands as Gradle tasks directly from the command-line:</p>

    <pre class="console">&gt; gradle build boxfuseRun -info</pre>

    <p>As you can see there is no need to manually specify the payload
        as Boxfuse will automatically default to use the project artifact.
    It also automatically uses the project name and version for the image.</p>

    <p class="alert alert-info"><strong>Tip:</strong> If you do not want to store your Boxfuse credentials directly
    in your build file, you can also simply store them in the
    <code>BOXFUSE_USER</code> and <code>BOXFUSE_SECRET</code>
    environment variables and they will be picked up automatically.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Build integration</h2>

    <p>Where Boxfuse really shines, is when you integrate it directly into
    your build. You can then:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>fuse your artifact into a new image</li>
    <li>launch an instance of that image on VirtualBox or your Boxfuse test
    environment on EC2</li>
        <li>execute your integration tests against it</li>
    <li>shut it down</li>
        <li>and if successful deploy the same image unchanged to
    your production environment on AWS</li>
        </ul>

    <p>How can you achieve all this
    with Boxfuse and Gradle? All you need is this simple configuration:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">buildscript {
    repositories {
        // https is disabled until https://issues.gradle.org/browse/GRADLE-3250 is fixed
        maven { url 'http://files.boxfuse.com' }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "com.boxfuse.client:boxfuse-gradle-plugin:{{site.boxfuseVersion}}"
    }
}

apply plugin: 'boxfuse'
apply plugin: 'java'

//Omitted dependencies, repositories, ...

//Run deploy &amp; run integration tests in test environment
boxfuse {
    env='test'
}
task boxfuseRunTest( type: com.boxfuse.client.gradle.task.RunTask )
task boxfuseKillTest( type: com.boxfuse.client.gradle.task.KillTask )
//Pass the url of the newly launched instance to the tests
task testConfig (dependsOn: boxfuseRunTest) << {
    project.tasks.test.systemProperty 'instanceUrl', boxfuse.instancesResult[0].url
}
test.dependsOn(testConfig)
//Always kill the test instance, even if the tests fail
test.finalizedBy(boxfuseKillTest)

//Deploy with zero-downtime on prod environment
extensions.create('boxfuseProd', com.boxfuse.client.gradle.BoxfuseExtension)
boxfuseProd {
    env='prod'
}
//Ensure we deploy the same image to prod as the one we just tested
task boxfuseProdConfig (dependsOn: boxfuseKillTest) << {
    project.tasks.boxfuseRunProd.extension = boxfuseProd
    boxfuseProd.image=boxfuse.image
}
task boxfuseRunProd( type: com.boxfuse.client.gradle.task.RunTask, dependsOn: boxfuseProdConfig )
check.dependsOn(boxfuseRunProd)</pre>

    <p>And now all you need to do is issue</p>

    <pre class="console">&gt; gradle build -info</pre>

    <p>And there you have it! Boxfuse will fuse an image,
        run and kill instances in multiple environments
        and more, all while integrated directly in your Gradle build.
    </p>

    <p>As you can see, you can pass <code>boxfuse.instancesResult[0].url</code>
    as a system property to your tests, so they know where the instance under test is running.
    <a href="/docs/gradle/run.html#dynamic-properties">Boxfuse dynamically sets this and others properties</a> after it launches an instance to
    make it easy for you to interact with your new instance.</p>

    <p class="alert alert-info"><strong>Tip:</strong> We extended our
        <a href="https://github.com/dropwizard/dwunikernel">Dropwizard sample project</a> with
        a <code>build.gradle</code> file so you can see it
        all in action and easily play with it for yourself.
