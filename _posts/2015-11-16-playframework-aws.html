<div>
    <p>When it comes to creating modern JVM-based applications we have a number of excellent choices including
        <a href="/blog/spring-boot-ec2">Spring Boot</a>,
        <a href="/blog/dropwizard-aws">Dropwizard</a>,
        <a href="/docs/payloads/tomcat">Tomcat</a>,
        <a href="/blog/javaee-aws">TomEE</a>
        and the <strong>Play Framework</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>Today we're going to look at <strong>deploying Play applications</strong> written in <strong>Scala</strong> effortlessly to <strong>AWS</strong>
        using <a href="/blog/welcome">Boxfuse</a>.</p>


    <p>We'll do so using the 3 core principles behind Boxfuse:</p>
    <table class="table">
        <tr>
            <td>1.</td>
            <td><a href="/learn/why"><strong><nobr>Immutable Infrastructure</nobr></strong></a></td>
            <td>Creating servers and never modifying them again by treating a server as one immutable
                unit that is regenerated after every change and promoted unchanged from environment to environment
                to eliminate drift and increase reliability by ensuring you run the exact same code in production as
                the one you tested in test.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2.</td>
            <td><a href="/learn/how"><strong>Minimal Images</strong></a></td>
            <td>Analysing your application and generating minimal tailor-made Linux-based images on the fly that
                are 100x smaller than a typical Linux system and take just seconds to produce.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3.</td>
            <td><strong>Blue/Green deployments</strong></td>
            <td>Deploying a new version of an app in parallel to the existing one and only making the switch at the elastic IP
                or elastic load balancer level once the configured health checks of the new version have passed. Deployments are fully
                automated and effectively transactional, providing you with zero-downtime updates.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

    <p>Before we get started ensure you have <a href="https://console.boxfuse.com">created a Boxfuse account</a> (it's free, just log in with your GitHub id).
        Make sure to associate it with your <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS account</a> in the <a href="https://console.boxfuse.com">Boxfuse console</a> to deploy on EC2.</p>
    <p>You will also need a <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">JDK</a>,
        the <a href="https://www.typesafe.com/activator/download">Typesafe Activator</a>
        and <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a> installed on your machine.</p>

    <h2>Step 0: Creating the Play application</h2>

    <p>Start by creating a Play Scala application using the Typesafe Activator:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> activator new hello play-scala</pre>

    <p>And navigate to the newly created directory:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> cd hello</pre>

    <p>Then set the version in <code>build.sbt</code> to 1.0:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">version := "1.0"</pre>

    <p>Finally build a distribution zip:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>hello&gt;</span> activator dist</pre>

    <p>Great. Your Play application distribution zip is now available under <code>target/universal/hello-1.0.zip</code>.</p>


    <h2>Step 1: Fusing a Boxfuse image and running it on VirtualBox</h2>

    <div class="blog-post-image center">
        <img src="/assets/posts/playframework-aws/bootableapp.png" alt="Play Framework App to Boxfuse Bootable App">
    </div>

    <p>Now it's time to fuse your application into a Boxfuse image and launch an instance of it on VirtualBox:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>hello&gt;</span> boxfuse run</pre>

    <p>This command will analyse your application and generate a minimal Linux-based image for it, which we call a
        Bootable App. It does this by combining
        your application itself with a JRE and a Linux kernel from the Boxfuse Component Inventory. It will then
        launch an instance of your new image on VirtualBox. When it completes you should see a message like this:</p>

    <pre class="console">Payload started in 00:06.688s -> http://127.0.0.1:10080</pre>

    <p>Now open your browser and navigate to this address to see your new application up and running within the new VirtualBox VM:</p>

    <img class="screenshot" src="/assets/img/getstarted/play-virtualbox.png">

    <p>You can also see your newly created image:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>hello&gt;</span> boxfuse ls

Images available locally:
+------------------+---------------+-------+---------+-----------+------------+---------+---------------------+
| Image            |    Payload    | Debug |  Java   | AppServer |   Ports    |  Size   |    Generated at     |
+------------------+---------------+-------+---------+-----------+------------+---------+---------------------+
| myuser/hello:1.0 | hello-1.0.jar | false | 8.60.22 | Play      | http -> 80 | 75950 K | 2015-11-12 14:57:50 |
+------------------+---------------+-------+---------+-----------+------------+---------+---------------------+
Total: 1</pre>

    <p>As well as the instance that is running:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>hello&gt;</span> boxfuse ps

Running Instances on VirtualBox in the dev environment :
+-------------+------------------+---------------------+------------------------+---------------------+
|  Instance   |      Image       |        Type         |           URL          |     Launched at     |
+-------------+------------------+---------------------+------------------------+---------------------+
| vb-b18d6746 | myuser/hello:1.0 | 4 CPU / 1024 MB RAM | http://127.0.0.1:10080 | 2015-11-12 14:57:56 |
+-------------+------------------+---------------------+------------------------+---------------------+
Total: 1</pre>

    <h2>Step 2: Deploying your application to AWS</h2>

    <p>Now let's deploy your image to AWS. As Boxfuse works with your AWS account, it first needs the necessary permissions to do so.
        So if you haven't already done it, go to the Boxfuse Console and <strong><a href="https://console.boxfuse.com/#/awsAccount">connect your AWS account</a></strong> now.</p>

    <p>Every new Boxfuse account comes with 3 environments: <code>dev</code>, <code>test</code> and <code>prod</code>.
        <code>dev</code> is your local VirtualBox environment and <code>test</code> and <code>prod</code> are on AWS.</p>

    <p>So let's deploy our application to the <code>prod</code> environment on AWS:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>hello&gt;</span> boxfuse run -env=prod

Pushing myuser/hello:1.0 ...
Verifying myuser/hello:1.0 ...
Waiting for AWS to create an AMI for myuser/hello:1.0 in eu-central-1 (this may take up to 50 seconds) ...
AMI created in 00:34.394s in eu-central-1 -> ami-ed988b81
Creating Elastic IP ...
Mapping hello-myuser.boxfuse.io to 52.28.107.167 ...
Creating security group boxsg-myuser-prod-hello-1.0 ...
Launching t2.micro instance of myuser/hello:1.0 (ami-ed988b81) in prod (eu-central-1) ...
Instance launched in 00:26.922s -> i-5de042e1
Waiting for AWS to boot Instance i-5de042e1 and Payload to start at http://52.28.121.55/ ...
Payload started in 00:51.516s -> http://52.28.121.55/
Remapping Elastic IP 52.28.107.167 to i-5de042e1 ...
Waiting 15s for AWS to complete Elastic IP Zero Downtime transition ...
Deployment completed successfully. myuser/hello:1.0 is up and running at http://hello-myuser.boxfuse.io/</pre>

    <p>Notice that Boxfuse has reused your image unchanged instead fusing a new one.</p>

    <p>With that one command Boxfuse has automatically pushed your image to the Boxfuse Vault, our secure only image repository,
        as well as <strong>provisioned,
        configured and secured all necessary AWS resources</strong> including a domain name, an elastic IP, a security group and
        your instance itself. There is no manual work necessary on your behalf.</p>

    <p>All you need to do is simply navigate to your new domain to see your Play application in action on AWS:</p>

    <img class="screenshot" src="/assets/img/getstarted/play-aws.png">

    <h2>Step 3: Updating your application using blue/green deployments</h2>

    <p>Now let's take things one step further and deploy an update of your application with <strong>zero downtime</strong> using blue/green deployments.</p>

    <p>Start by modifying <code>app/controllers/Application.scala</code> with a simple change:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">package controllers

import play.api._
import play.api.mvc._

class Application extends Controller {
  def index = Action {
    Ok(views.html.index("Updated by Boxfuse with zero downtime!"))
  }
}</pre>

    <p>then bump the version in <code>build.sbt</code>:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">version := "1.1"</pre>

    <p>and rebuild the dist:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>hello&gt;</span> activator clean dist</pre>

    <p>Finally, deploy the new version of your application to AWS:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>hello&gt;</span> boxfuse run -env=prod

Fusing Image for hello-1.1.zip ...
Image fused in 00:09.817s (75949 K) -> myuser/hello:1.1
Pushing myuser/hello:1.1 ...
Verifying myuser/hello:1.1 ...
Waiting for AWS to create an AMI for myuser/hello:1.1 in eu-central-1 (this may take up to 50 seconds) ...
AMI created in 00:34.152s in eu-central-1 -> ami-8b988be7
Creating security group boxsg-myuser-prod-hello-1.1 ...
Launching t2.micro instance of myuser/hello:1.1 (ami-8b988be7) in prod (eu-central-1) ...
Instance launched in 00:35.372s -> i-ebea4857
Waiting for AWS to boot Instance i-ebea4857 and Payload to start at http://52.29.129.239/ ...
Payload started in 01:05.316s -> http://52.29.129.239/
Remapping Elastic IP 52.28.107.167 to i-ebea4857 ...
Waiting 15s for AWS to complete Elastic IP Zero Downtime transition ...
Terminating instance i-5de042e1 ...
Destroying Security Group sg-48ea9921 ...
Deployment completed successfully. myuser/hello:1.1 is up and running at http://hello-myuser.boxfuse.io/</pre>

    <p>And there it is:</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Summary</h2>

    <p>In this post, we saw how to <strong>deploy and update a Play Framework Scala application to AWS</strong> in 3 easy steps. First
    we fused our application into an minimal image called a Bootable App and ran an instance of it on VirtualBox. We then
    deployed the same image unchanged to AWS. And finally we updated our application on AWS with zero downtime using
    blue/green deployments.</p>

    <p>To do so we used <strong><a href="/">Boxfuse</a></strong> and its 3 core principles:
        <a href="/learn/why"><strong><nobr>Immutable Infrastructure</nobr></strong></a>,
        <a href="/learn/how"><strong>Minimal Images</strong></a>,
        <strong>Blue/Green deployments</strong>.</p>
