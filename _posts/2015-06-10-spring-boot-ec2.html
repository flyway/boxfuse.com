    <p>Lately the JVM-world has finally started embracing solutions that just work.
        Gone are the days where you had to manually wire together many components and write large amounts of XML configuration
        just to make things work. Today it is all about being productive from the get go. And to us this is really music to our ears.
        Our products (<a href="http://flywaydb.org">Flyway</a> &amp; <a href="https://boxfuse.com">Boxfuse</a>) have always adhered to this exact design principle from the start.
        And so regardless of whether
    you easily want to migrate your
        relational databases or fuse your applications into bootable apps, <a href="http://flywaydb.org">Flyway</a> &amp; <a href="https://boxfuse.com">Boxfuse</a>
        work very had to make you successful. Rapidly and reliably.</p>

    <p>Pivotal has now gone the same way and tied their entire portfolio of Spring frameworks and libraries
    into a fantastic framework called <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a>. It is a turn-key solution to the Spring ecosystem.</p>

    <p>At its core, <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a> combines your
    application with an embedded container and all its other libraries into a single executable jar that can easily
    be deployed onto any system. It adds lots of auto-configuration and integration options to make your
        application production-ready from day one. In fact Spring Boot even offers
        <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-database-initialization.html#howto-execute-flyway-database-migrations-on-startup">out of the box integration for
        Flyway</a> so adopting industry best practices like database migrations has never been easier.</p>

    <p>In this post we'll <strong>take Spring Boot's idea of executable jars to its natural conclusion</strong>:
        fusing your Spring Boot application together with a JVM and a kernel into a immutable bootable app that can be run unchanged on both VirtualBox and EC2.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Prequisites</h2>

    <p>Before we get started ensure you have <a href="https://console.boxfuse.com">created a Boxfuse account</a> (it's free, just log in with your GitHub id).
        Make sure to associate it with your <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS account</a> in the <a href="https://console.boxfuse.com">Boxfuse console</a> to deploy on EC2.</p>
    <p>You will also need Java, Maven and VirtualBox installed on your machine.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Creating a Spring Boot app</h2>

    <p>Creating a new Spring Boot app is incredibly easy. The Spring Boot website provides a simple service at
        <a href="https://start.spring.io">start.spring.io</a> to create
    application skeletons directly via http. To create the application for this post, you can
        either <a href="https://start.spring.io/starter.zip?baseDir=springbootec2&groupId=boxfusedemo&artifactId=springbootec2&version=1.0&name=springbootec2&description=Demo+project+for+Spring+Boot+on+EC2+blog+post+at+https%3A%2F%2Fboxfuse.com%2Fblog%2Fspring-boot-ec2.html&packageName=springbootec2&type=maven-project&packaging=jar&javaVersion=1.8&language=java&bootVersion=1.2.4.RELEASE&style=web&style=actuator&generate-project=">click to generate the application</a> and extract it or type this one-liner:</p>

    <pre class="console">&gt; curl "https://start.spring.io/starter.zip?baseDir=springbootec2&groupId=boxfusedemo&artifactId=springbootec2&version=1.0&name=springbootec2&description=Demo+project+for+Spring+Boot+on+EC2+blog+post+at+https%3A%2F%2Fboxfuse.com%2Fblog%2Fspring-boot-ec2.html&packageName=springbootec2&type=maven-project&packaging=jar&javaVersion=1.8&language=java&bootVersion=1.2.4.RELEASE&style=web&style=actuator&generate-project=" > springbootec2.zip &amp;&amp; unzip springbootec2.zip</pre>

    <p>Now change to the newly created directory and you'll find the following structure:</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image">
        <img src="/assets/posts/spring-boot-ec2/structure.png" alt="Spring Boot project structure">
    </div>

    <p>To be able to interact with the application you'll need a controller, so go ahead and create one as <code>springbootec2.HelloController</code> with the following contents:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">package springbootec2;
    
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMethod;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

@RestController
public class HelloController {
    @RequestMapping(value = "/hello", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public Map&lt;String, Object&gt; hello(@RequestParam(value = "name", defaultValue = "Boxfuse") String name) {
        Map&lt;String, Object&gt; result = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
        result.put("greeting", "Hello " + name + "!");
        return result;
    }
}</pre>

    <p>Your application is now fully set up. As your skeleton also includes Spring Boot's actuator (their turn-key production readiness features), you now have two urls available:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/hello</code> : your controller</li>
        <li><code>/health</code> : Spring Boot's health check page</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Go ahead and try it by executing</p>

    <pre class="console">&gt; mvn package</pre>

    <p>followed by</p>

    <pre class="console">&gt; java -jar target/springbootec2-1.0.jar</pre>

    <p>You should now be able to see it in action at <a href="http://localhost:8080/hello?name=world" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/hello?name=world</a>:</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Fusing it into a Boxfuse Bootable App</h2>

    <p><strong>To ensure an application runs reliably on another environment, always strive to package and transport it at the lowest level possible.</strong>
    Spring Boot already helps you part of the way by embedding the application server and all other other libraries
    directly into the executable jar. This is great as it avoids the need to separately install and update an application on each individual instance.
    However you are still responsible for ensuring the base operating system, its libraries and the JVM are properly installed, updated and configured.</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image center">
        <img src="/assets/posts/spring-boot-ec2/war-springboot-boxfuse.png" alt="War file -> Spring Boot -> Boxfuse">
    </div>

    <p><strong>Boxfuse starts where Spring Boot leaves off.</strong> It takes your Spring Boot executable jar and fuses it with a JVM and a Linux kernel
        into a single immutable unit called a Bootable App. This Bootable App is created in seconds and takes just 1% of the size of a regular system.
        It only contains your app and its direct dependencies. Nothing else. Boxfuse does away with the operating system and the provisioning as you know it.
        Instead it analyses your application and <strong>generates a very efficient tailor-made image on the fly</strong>. This image can then be launched
        unchanged on VirtualBox and AWS. No intermediate OS, runtime daemon or other installation is required. It <strong>runs directly on your virtualization layer</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>To fuse your Spring Boot executable jar into a Boxfuse Bootble simply issue this command:</p>

    <pre class="console">&gt; boxfuse fuse target/springbootec2-1.0.jar

Fusing Image for springbootec2-1.0.jar ...
Image fused in 00:06.423s (53253 K) -> axelfontaine/springbootec2:1.0</pre>

    <p>In just a few seconds Boxfuse took your Spring Boot executable jar (12 MB) and fused it into a 53 MB image containing a Java 8 JVM and a kernel:</p>

    <pre class="console">&gt; boxfuse ls

Images available locally:
+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+---------+-------------+------------+---------+
| Image                          |        Payload        | Debug |  Java   |  AppServer  |   Ports    |  Size   |
+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+---------+-------------+------------+---------+
| axelfontaine/springbootec2:1.0 | springbootec2-1.0.jar | false | 8.45.14 | Spring Boot | http -> 80 | 53253 K |
+--------------------------------+-----------------------+-------+---------+-------------+------------+---------+
Total: 1</pre>

    <p>Boxfuse has <a href="/docs/payloads/springboot.html">built-in deep integration for Spring Boot applications</a>.
        It automatically detects the Spring Boot actuator health check urls as well as the port configuration.</p>

    <p>To ensure your application can configure itself correctly, Boxfuse automatically activates a Spring profile called <code>boxfuse</code> on startup.</p>

    <p>Time to see it in action. Launch your shiny new bootable app on VirtualBox with one command:</p>

    <pre class="console">&gt; boxfuse run springbootec2:1.0

Launching Instance of axelfontaine/springbootec2:1.0 on VirtualBox ...
Forwarding http port localhost:8888 -> vb-9b5be89b:80
Instance launched in 00:06.005s -> vb-9b5be89b
Waiting for Payload to start on Instance vb-9b5be89b ...
vb-9b5be89b => <em>instance boot messages omitted</em>
vb-9b5be89b => <em>...</em>
vb-9b5be89b => <em>...</em>
Payload started in 00:07.490s -> http://127.0.0.1:8888</pre>

    <p>Your VirtualBox instance is now up and running as you can see in your browser:</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image">
        <img src="/assets/posts/spring-boot-ec2/helloboxfuse.png" alt="Hello Boxfuse!">
    </div>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Running it unchanged on EC2</h2>

    <p>Now that you've successfully fused your Spring Boot executable jar into an image and booted it on VirtualBox,
    it is time to launch an instance of it on EC2. By default Boxfuse <a href="/docs/#environments">supports 3 environments</a>: <code>dev</code> (default, VirtualBox),
    <code>test</code> (AWS) and <code>prod</code> (AWS).</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image center">
        <img src="/assets/img/environments.png" alt="Environments">
    </div>

    <p>So in this case, all you need to do is switch the environment to <code>prod</code>:</p>

    <pre class="console">&gt; boxfuse run springbootec2:1.0 -env=prod

Creating axelfontaine/springbootec2 ...

Deployment completed successfully. axelfontaine/springbootec2:1.0 is up and running at http://springbootec2-axelfontaine.boxfuse.io</pre>

    <p>And there you have it:</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image">
        <img src="/assets/posts/spring-boot-ec2/helloec2.png" alt="Hello EC2">
    </div>

    <p>So what just happened here? Quite a few things! In about <strong>60 seconds</strong> Boxfuse</p>
    <ul>
        <li>encrypted and signed your image (springbootec2:1.0)</li>
        <li>uploaded it to the Boxfuse Vault & verified the signature</li>
        <li>created a new AWS elastic IP (52.28.128.122)</li>
        <li>created a new domain name (springbootec2-axelfontaine.boxfuse.io)</li>
        <li>mapped the domain name to the elastic ip</li>
        <li>converted your image to an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)</li>
        <li>created an AWS security group based on the port information it detected when fusing the image</li>
        <li>launched a t2.micro instance based on the newly created AMI</li>
        <li>checked the health of your app at <code>/health</code> based on the Spring Boot actuactor configuration</li>
        <li>remapped the AWS elastic IP to your new instance</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All of this with a <strong>single command</strong> and no additional configuration required.</p>

    <p>You can also <strong>integrate Boxfuse directly into your build</strong> by using either the <a href="/docs/maven">Boxfuse Maven Plugin</a>
    or the <a href="/docs/gradle">Boxfuse Gradle Plugin</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Summary</h2>

    <p>In this post you saw why <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a> is a great way to be productive from the get go with Spring. We saw that by embedding
    the application server and all other libraries directly into an executable jar, you gain greater consistency between environments.
    We then took this idea to its natural conclusion and used <a href="https://boxfuse.com">Boxfuse</a> to fuse the Spring Boot executable in a Bootable App that
    bundles all direct dependencies of the application all the way down to the OS kernel. The image was created in seconds and measured just a few MBs.
        We ran it on VirtualBox and deployed it unchanged in under 60 seconds on AWS with a single command. What you have here is the
        <strong>simplest and most reliable way to run your Spring Boot applications on EC2</strong>.</p>
