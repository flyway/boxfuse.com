    <p>Build tool integration has always been a priority for us at <a href="https://boxfuse.com">Boxfuse</a>. It is
        an essential part of a smooth development and deployment workflow. Back in May we extended our support beyond
        <a href="/docs/maven">Maven</a> and released to the <a href="/docs/gradle">Boxfuse Gradle plugin</a>,
        both of which have been steadily improved ever since.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-section">Gradle Plugin Portal</h2>

    <p>Recently Gradle has been making it easier and easier to both find and use plugins. There is now an official Gradle Plugin portal,
        making it easy to discover new plugins and keep track of new releases.</p>

    <p>We are happy to announce that as of today the <strong><a href="https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.boxfuse.client">Boxfuse Gradle Plugin</a></strong> is now available there too:</p>

    <div class="blog-post-image center">
        <img src="/assets/posts/gradle-plugin-portal/portal.png" alt="Boxfuse on the Gradle Plugin portal">
    </div>

    <p>And that's is just the beginning. If you are using Gradle 2.1 or newer you can now also use the new and improved plugin syntax:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint">plugins {
    id "com.boxfuse.client" version "{{site.boxfuseVersion}}"
}</pre>

    <p><strong>Using Boxfuse with Gradle has never been easier!</strong></p>

    <p>Have fun! And if you haven't already,
        <a href="https://console.boxfuse.com"><strong>sign up for your
        Boxfuse account</strong></a> now. All you need is a GitHub user
