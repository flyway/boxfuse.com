    for Boxfuse (as of 2017-03-31)
    <p class="doc-section">1.	Definitions, validity</p>
    <p>1.1.	Boxfuse GmbH, Scwedenstr. 9/Gebäude 1, 13359 Berlin, Germany (hereinafter referred to as “Boxfuse”) provides a platform for software developers (hereinafter referred to as the “service”) at “boxfuse.com”.</p>
    <p>1.2.	All users of the service are subject to the following terms of service (hereinafter referred to as “terms”). These terms are available at any time from <a href="https://boxfuse.com/terms">https://boxfuse.com/terms</a>. The valid version of the terms at the time of registration applies.</p>
    <p class="doc-section">2.	Service specification</p>
    <p>2.1.	The service offers users the possibility to create bootable apps (machine images), virtual machines or other instances using a client software provided by Boxfuse (hereinafter referred to as “Boxfuse Client”) and to deploy these locally or on a production server (hereinafter referred to as “service”), although the production server is not operated by Boxfuse. The service rather accesses existing hosting platforms of third-party providers that the customer is already authorized to use. The user agrees that Boxfuse may use these hosting platforms throughout the duration of the service agreement.</p>
    <p>2.2.	All features of the service are explained, where necessary, in the respective places or on the Boxfuse website. The user can continually use the features of the service that are included in the service package booked by the user. The available service packages are described and available for download on the Boxfuse website.</p>
    <p class="doc-section">3.	Registration, conclusion of contract, costs</p>
    <p>3.1.	If the user wishes to use the service provided by Boxfuse, he/she can create a customer account at <a href="https://console.boxfuse.com">https://console.boxfuse.com</a>. The user can register on the Boxfuse website using an account from his/her existing authentication service (such as Amazon or GitHub). After entering the required data (username, password) and confirming that the user is not a consumer and that he/she accepts the terms and the data collection and processing by the Boxfuse website, a click on the “Get Started” button constitutes a binding offer to Boxfuse to finalize a service agreement. The offer does not constitute a conclusion of a contract. Following Boxfuse’s receipt of the offer, the user is verified with the authentication service and the account is activated. The user is sent confirmation by email, which is sent to the email address of the authentication service account that was used for registration. In activating the user account, acceptance of the user’s offer to conclude a contract is confirmed. Setting up a customer account is free of charge to the user.</p>
    <p><strong>Booking a service package</strong></p>
    <p>3.2.	Boxfuse offers the service in the form of various service packages, each with a different scope of service and each with a different price. The user can book his/her selected service package using his/her customer account on the Boxfuse website. The selected service package remains valid until it is cancelled or until the user selects a different service package and this becomes active.</p>
    <p><strong>Costs, billing period</strong></p>
    <p>3.3.	The various service packages and their costs are described in detail on the Boxfuse website. The costs of using the service shall be due each month in the currency specified on the Boxfuse website.

If the day of the end of a billing month does exist in that month, the billing month ends on expiry of the last day of this month.</p>
    <p><strong>Changing a booked service package</strong></p>
    <p>3.4.	The customer can switch from one service package to another at any time. If the customer switches to a larger (more expensive) service package, a new billing month starts on the day of the switch. Prepayments that have already been made for a smaller service package shall be proportionately offset according to the number of days that have not yet been used up against the costs of the first month of the new service package. The change becomes effective immediately after payment of the resulting difference has been made.</p>
    <p>3.5.	If the customer switches to a smaller service package (less expensive or free of charge), the switch becomes effective at the end of the current billing month. The new service package begins at the start of the next billing month.</p>
    <p class="doc-section">4.	Payment</p>
    <p>4.1.	If the user selects a service package that is subject to a fee or selects it through switching  service package, the fee for the services included in the package are due in advance each month. The user can make payment using the payment methods available on the Boxfuse website.</p>
    <p>4.2.	The user is responsible for all costs incurred if a fee cannot be debited, particularly any resulting bank charges from a rejected direct debit and the like, provided that the user is responsible for these costs having been incurred.</p>
    <p>4.3.	The selected service package will only be activated after successful prepayment.</p>

    <p>6.1.	The contract is concluded for an indefinite period.</p>
    <p>6.2.	The customer can cancel the contract to the end of a billing month without compliance to a notice period. The contract can be cancelled by Boxfuse to the end of a billing month with a notice period of 3 months. Notice of cancellation must be given in written or electronic form. The date of cancellation is deemed as being the date that the other party receives the cancellation notice. The user account will be deactivated when the contract ends.</p>

    <p>8.1.	The user is obligated to refrain from all actions that could lead to an excessive burden on the service, the Boxfuse website or Boxfuse’s systems, or that could jeopardize the integrity, stability or availability of the IT systems of the service or the Boxfuse website.</p>
