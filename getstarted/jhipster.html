<p>This tutorial will get you started with Boxfuse and JHipster. It should take you about <strong>5-10
    minutes</strong> to complete.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before you begin, ensure you have successfully:</p>
<ol>
    <li>created a <strong><a href="https://console.boxfuse.com">Boxfuse Account</a></strong> (simply log in with your
        GitHub account, it's free)
    </li>
    <li>downloaded and installed the latest <strong><a href="/getstarted/download">Boxfuse Client</a></strong></li>
    <li>downloaded and installed the latest version of <strong><a href="https://jhipster.github.io/installation/">JHipster</a></strong> (including Git, Node.js, Yeoman, Bower, Gulp and JHipster itself)</li>
    <li>downloaded and installed the latest version of <strong><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a></strong></li>
    <li>downloaded and installed the latest <strong><a
            href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">JDK</a></strong> with <code>JAVA_HOME</code>
        set up correctly
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Creating the JHipster application</h2>

<p>Start by creating a new directory:</p>
<pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> mkdir getstarted-jhipster</pre>

<p>And navigate to it:</p>
<pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> cd getstarted-jhipster</pre>

<p>Now create the application:</p>
<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-jhipster&gt;</span> yo jhipster</pre>

<p>And select all defaults except for the database where you should pick PostgreSQL instead and for the internationalization where you can say no.</p>

<p>Once that's done, set the project version to <code>1.0</code> in <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">...
<del>&lt;version&gt;0.0.1-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;</del>
<strong>&lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;</strong>
...</pre>

<p>Your application is now fully set up. Go ahead and build it:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-jhipster&gt;</span> mvnw -Pprod -DskipTests package</pre>

<p>Great. Your Spring Boot application is now available under <code>target/jhipster-1.0.war</code>.</p>

<h2>Fusing a Boxfuse image and running it locally on VirtualBox</h2>

<p>Now it's time to fuse your application into a Boxfuse image and launch an instance of it on VirtualBox:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-jhipster&gt;</span> boxfuse run

Creating jhipster ...
Mapping jhipster-dev-myuser.boxfuse.io to 127.0.0.1 ...
Created App jhipster (single-instance / postgresql)

Waiting for Payload to start on vb-2dc97023:8080 (expecting HTTP 200 at / within 300s) ...
Payload started in 00:10.041s -> http://127.0.0.1:8080</pre>

<p>Boxfuse has automatically detected the PostgreSQL dependency and used the <code>8080</code> port to check
    whether the instance came up correctly.</p>

<p>Open a browser at this address to see your new application up and running within the VirtualBox VM by simply
    executing:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-jhipster&gt;</span> boxfuse open</pre>

<img class="screenshot" src="/assets/img/getstarted/jhipster-virtualbox.png">

<p>You can also see your newly created image:</p>

<pre class="console" style="font-size: 95%"><span>getstarted-jhipster&gt;</span> boxfuse ls

<p>As well as the instance that is running:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-jhipster&gt;</span> boxfuse ps

Total: 1</pre>

<h2>Deploying your application to AWS</h2>

<p>Now let's deploy the image to AWS. As Boxfuse works with your AWS account, it first needs the necessary permissions
    to do so.
    So if you haven't already done it, go to the Boxfuse Console and <strong><a
            href="https://console.boxfuse.com/#/awsAccount">connect your AWS account</a></strong> now.</p>

<p>Every new Boxfuse account comes with 3 environments: <code>dev</code>, <code>test</code> and <code>prod</code>.
    <code>dev</code> is your local VirtualBox environment and <code>test</code> and <code>prod</code> are on AWS.</p>

<p>So let's deploy our application to the <code>prod</code> environment on AWS:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-jhipster&gt;</span> boxfuse run -env=prod

<div style="font-size: 90%">Pushing myuser/getstarted-springboot:1.0 ...

<p>Notice that Boxfuse has reused your image unchanged instead fusing a new one.</p>

<p>With that one command Boxfuse has automatically pushed your image to the Boxfuse Vault as well as provisioned,
    configured and secured all necessary AWS resources. There is no manual work necessary on your behalf.</p>

<p>All you need to do is simply navigate to your new domain to see your JHipster application in action on AWS:</p>

<h2>Bonus: update your application with zero downtime</h2>

<p>Now let's take things one step further and deploy an update of your application with zero downtime using blue/green
    deployments.</p>

<p>Start by modifying <code>src/main/webapp/app/home/home.html</code> and change the message:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">...
<del>&lt;h1&gt;Welcome, Java Hipster!&lt;/h1&gt;</del>
<strong>&lt;h1&gt;Updated by Boxfuse with zero downtime!&lt;/h1&gt;</strong>
...</pre>

<p>then bump the version in <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">...
<del>&lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;</del>
<strong>&lt;version&gt;2.0&lt;/version&gt;</strong>
...</pre>

<p>and rebuild the war:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-jhipster&gt;</span> mvnw -Pprod -DskipTests package</pre>

<p>Finally deploy the new version of your application to AWS:</p>

<pre class="console"><span>getstarted-jhipster&gt;</span> boxfuse run -env=prod

<p>And there it is:</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this brief guide we have seen how to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>create a JHipster application</li>
    <li>fuse it into a Boxfuse image</li>
    <li>deploy the image locally on VirtualBox</li>
    <li>deploy the image unchanged to AWS</li>
    <li>update the application with zero downtime</li>
</ul>

<p>Now it's your turn. Take your favorite JHipster application and deploy it with ease and pleasure.</p>
<p>And don't forget, Boxfuse also comes with a <a href="/docs/maven">Maven</a>
    and a <a href="/docs/gradle">Gradle</a> plugin to seamlessly integrate with your CI/CD workflow.</p>
