    <p class="doc-title">How Boxfuse works</p>

    <p>It all starts with your application (.jar or .war file if JVM-based). With a single command Boxfuse will
        analyse it and produce the smallest possible Machine Image to run it: a Bootable App.</p>

    <p>You can then use Boxfuse to deploy and run this Bootable App unchanged, both locally and in the cloud:</p>

    <p class="doc-section">Bootable App</p>

    <p>Compared to a traditional Machine Image, a Boxfuse Bootable App has a number of advantages:</p>

    <p><img src="/assets/img/getstarted/microos.png" alt="Micro OS"/></p>

    <p>Instead of tediously installing, configuring and tuning a legacy OS, <strong>Boxfuse generates a Micro OS, in
        seconds.</strong></p>

    <p>To do this, Boxfuse analyses your App to determine its technical dependencies. It then pulls the necessary items
        from the
        Boxfuse Component Inventory and fuses it all together in a Bootable App which is:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>a single <strong>immutable unit</strong> generated in seconds</li>
        <li>just a <strong>few MBs</strong> in size</li>
        <li>hardened and <strong>secure</strong> by design</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="doc-section">Deployment</p>

    <p>Boxfuse can then deploy your Bootable App unchanged on any of the supported platforms:</p>

    <p><img src="/assets/img/getstarted/deploy.png" alt="Deployment"/></p>

    <p>This way you can completely eliminate surprises and <strong>run the exact same Bootable App on multiple platforms</strong>.
        Boxfuse
        achieves this by converting the Bootable App into a format specific for each platform (VMDK, AMI) and launching
        an Instance.</p>

    <p>By their very nature these instances have:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>fast startup times</li>
        <li>a low resource footprint</li>
        <li>the smallest possible attack surface</li>
    </ul>
