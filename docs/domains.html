    <p>When Boxfuse deploys your app it will automatically create a <code>boxfuse.io</code> subdomain like
        <code>myapp-myuser.boxfuse.io</code> for you to easily access it.</p>

    <p>If your application is externally visible you may want to use your own domain though, like <code>myapp.mygreatcompany.com</code>.</p>

    <h2>Using Route 53</h2>
    <p>If you use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/">AWS Route 53</a> to manage your domain, you can simply
        configure the domain for your app by configuring it in the Boxfuse Console:</p>

    <p><img class="max-width-image screenshot" src="/assets/img/custom-domain.png"></p>

    <p>In this example where you own the domain <code>mygreatcompany.com</code> and it is managed by AWS Route 53,
        your application will now be available under <code>myapp.mygreatcompany.com</code>.</p>

    <p>Alternatively you can of course also configure this with the Boxfuse Client using the <a href="/docs/commandline/cfg#domain">-domain=... parameter</a>.</p>

    <h2>Using another DNS provider</h2>

    <p>If you host your DNS records outside of Route 53, you must create a new <strong>CNAME record</strong> which point to the domain generated by Boxfuse.</p>
    <p>In the example above, the new CNAME record for the <code>myapp.com.</code> domain would be called <code>www</code>
    and would point to <code>myapp-myuser.boxfuse.io</code>. Your application will then be available under <code>www.myapp.com</code>.</p>
