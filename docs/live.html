<p><i>This feature in currently available on Windows and Mac OSX machines only.</i></p>

<p>In the <a href="/docs/environments">dev environment</a> on <a href="/docs/virtualbox">VirtualBox</a> Boxfuse supports
    creating instances with <strong>live reloading</strong> by using the <code>-live</code> flag when fusing them. The is great for super-fast turnarounds,
    with <strong>changes visible immediately</strong>. This avoids the need to wait for a full kill/fuse/run cycle
    (which is still pretty fast and usually takes less than 10 seconds).</p>

<p>Boxfuse achieves this by combining two techniques:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>mounting your application files directory</strong> as an NFS share within your instance</li>
    <li>adding a <strong>reloading agent</strong> to your instance to reload your application when needed</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that due to the NFS dependency on your local application files directory, images with live reloading cannot be pushed to the Boxfuse Vault.</p>

<h2 id="jvm">JVM apps</h2>

<p>For JVM apps, Boxfuse supports mounting exploded jars, exploded wars and exploded Play zips directly into your instance. Additionally Boxfuse automatically
configures your JVM to use the <strong>Spring Loaded</strong> Java Agent for automatically reloading classes when the underlying class file changes.</p>

<p>You can also combine this with <a href="/docs/debugging">debugging</a> and <a href="/docs/profiling">profiling</a> for a great local dev experience.</p>

<h2 id="nodejs">Node.js apps</h2>

<p>For Node.js apps, Boxfuse supports mounting your Node.js application directory (the one containing <code>package.json</code>) directly into your instance.
    Additionally, Boxfuse automatically starts your Node.js app with <strong>node-supervisor</strong> to ensure it is properly restarted
    whenever js files change.
