    <p>Sometimes you need to understand exactly what's going on inside your instances.
    Boxfuse makes it trivial to remotely debug your apps, regardless of whether they run on VirtualBox or AWS.</p>

    <h2>Enabling remote debugging</h2>

    <p>To enable remote debugging simply fuse or run your image with <code>-debug</code>. This will open an additional
    port to which your debugger can connect. As the JVM debugging protocol doesn't have any authentication, by default
        this <a href="/blog/restricted-ports">port is restricted</a> to only allow connections from the IP address of
    your local machine.</p>

    <p>When you launch an instance of an image set up for remote debugging you should see a message like this:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> boxfuse run myapp.jar -debug

...

Ready to accept remote debugger connections -> tcp://127.0.0.1:5005</pre>

    <p>If you need to debug an application startup issue, you can add <code>-debug.wait</code> to make the app wait
    for a remote debugger connection before starting up.</p>

    <h2>Configuring the debug port</h2>

    <p>You can configure both the port number as well as the restrictions by manually specifying <code>-ports.debug=...</code>
    when fusing or running your image. You can use any of the <a href="/docs/commandline/fuse#ports">usual formats</a> for
    defining the port. Just remember that the protocol must be <code>tcp</code> and that you of course should be able to access it.</p>

    <h2>Connecting from your IDE</h2>

    <p>You can then simply connect the debugger of your favorite IDE to that address:</p>

    <p>And now simply add breakpoints, step through the code, and evaluate expressions as you normally would.</p>
