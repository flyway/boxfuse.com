    <p class="doc-title">Privacy Policy</p>
    for Boxfuse (as of 2015-02-22)
    <p class="doc-section">1.	General</p>
    <p>This privacy policy and the consent described in it applies to all features of the services offered by Boxfuse GmbH at  boxfuse.com (hereinafter referred to as “Boxfuse”).</p>
    <p><strong>You hereby expressly consent to the collection, processing and use of your personal data to the extent described in this privacy policy.</strong></p>
    <p class="doc-section">2.	Collected data when using the website</p>
    <p>You may visit our website without entering personal details. We only store credentials that have no personal reference, such as the IP address, and therefore the name of your internet service provider, the web page from which you visit us or the name of a requested file. This data is only evaluated to help improve our offer and it does not allow us to determine your identity. Personal data is only collected to the extent described in this privacy policy or if you voluntarily provide it to us when creating a user account, at a later stage when managing your user account, in connection with using Boxfuse Client, or if you expressly consent to this data being collected.</p>
    <p class="doc-section">3.	Collected data in connection with a user account</p>
    <p>A new user account is created using an existing user account with a service that is intended for use on multiple websites and for registration with multiple services, such as an Amazon or GitHub account (“authentication service”). We always store collected data in encrypted form, using encryption with AES-256 or a similarly secure algorithm. If data has to be made searchable in order to ensure the functionality of the Boxfuse service, it is also stored as a cryptographically secure hash. The key is never stored in the database. The data can only be encrypted and decrypted by the Boxfuse service.</p>
    <p>3.1.	Data collection during initial log-in</p>
    <p>When you log in for the first time, we store the data that is transmitted and provided by the authentication service, which is required when a user logs in to Boxfuse in the future. If you agree to our terms and this privacy policy when registering, we will also record the time of your acceptance in your user account, which is also created at this moment.</p>
    <p>3.2.	Data collection for the deployment of instances</p>
    <p>To deploy bootable apps (machine images), virtual machines or other instances (jointly referred to as “instances”) on a hosting or cloud service provider (“service provider”) that is supported by us, you will need to provide us with the relevant credentials. You can enter these yourself in the administrative section of your Boxfuse account on the Boxfuse website. We store and use the data in order to access your account with your service provider and to transfer, execute and manage the instances there.</p>
    <p>3.3.	Data collection when updating or entering a billing address</p>
    <p>When entering your billing address, we store your company name, company address, your EU Reverse Charge VAT ID and the EU Reverse Charge VAT ID validation, if applicable.</p>
    <p>3.4.	Data collection for a credit card saved as means of payment</p>
    <p>If you enter your credit card details as means of payment, we store the last four digits of the credit card number, the owner as stated on the credit card, as well as the month and year that the credit card expires. The complete credit card details are saved in PCI compliant form by the company Stripe (<a href="https://stripe.com/global">https://stripe.com/global</a>), who process payment transactions on our behalf.</p>
    <p class="doc-section">4.	Data collected in connection with Boxfuse Client and deploying instances</p>
    <p>For each case of deploying a new instance with a service provider, the application is first registered with the service provider according to the service provider’s mechanisms. The data provided by the service provider that is required for operating and monitoring the instance is stored by Boxfuse to enable it to provide the services offered.</p>
    <p class="doc-section">5.	Newsletter</p>
    <p>Boxfuse offers an email newsletter. If you subscribe to this newsletter, you agree that Boxfuse GmbH may send you email advertising for Boxfuse or other offers from Boxfuse GmbH to the email address registered in your user account. You can un-subscribe from the email newsletter at any time. You will find details on how to do this in each email newsletter.</p>
    <p class="doc-section">6.	Objection</p>
    <p>You may object to the use of your data at any time with future effect by contacting us using the details below. Please note that Boxfuse only collects, stores and processes the data that is necessary for operating the service. If you object to the use of your data, use of the service will be restricted or not at all possible.</p>
    <p class="doc-section">7.	Use of cookies</p>
    <p>When the user’s web browser communicates with the Boxfuse dashboard, an encrypted cookie is sent to determine the identity of the user. This cookie is also stored locally on the user’s computer in encrypted form. Likewise, the browser also automatically sends a user agent header by default. The browser automatically sends this header as soon as a connection has been established. This is not specific to Boxfuse. This header contains various information which is transmitted to us by your browser, such as the type and version of the operating system or the type and version of the browser. When Boxfuse Client communicates with the Boxfuse dashboard, a user agent header is also sent, similar to the web browser. It contains the type and version of the operating system, the type and version of the client, the version of Java Runtime and which Build Tool version was used (for Build Tool Plugin only).</p>
    <p class="doc-section">8.	Right to information</p>
